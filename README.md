# exo_lightning_code
Python code to reproduce figures from [Braam et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac2722). Folder FastJX_fluxes_Figure1 also contains scripts that generate [Fast-JX](https://www.ess.uci.edu/group/prather/scholar_software) photolysis files for exoplanets, showing how to convert stellar spectra (from the [BT-settl](http://svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/theory/newov2/index.php?models=bt-settl) library or the [MUSCLES](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/muscles/) spectral survey) onto the Fast-JX wavelength bins.
